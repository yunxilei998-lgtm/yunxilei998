                        This portfolio weaves three interconnected strands of reflection, shaped by key texts, movements, and narratives from my MA programme. The first strand emerges from weekly engagements with <em>Anatomy of an AI System</em> (Crawford & Joler, 2018), challenging me to reposition AI as materially embedded infrastructure rather than abstract technology, while probing digital methodologies for climate equity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        The second strand is informed by the Digital Humanities Climate Coalition’s (DHCC) <em>Statement on Open Data</em> (2021), which awakened me to the environmental footprint of digital scholarship and the imperative of sustainable research practices. The third strand traces reflections on open knowledge ethics, inspired by Aaron Swartz’s activism as portrayed in <em>The Internet’s Own Boy</em> (Knappenberger, 2014), and explores how open access regulations can transform educational equity through scientific rigor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Prior to these engagements, I regarded AI and technological innovations—from Tesla’s electric vehicles to consumer electronics—as neutral triumphs of human ingenuity, designed to benefit society. <em>Anatomy of an AI System</em> shattered this illusion, revealing the extractive violence, resource depletion, and electronic waste inherent in even “sustainable” technologies. Similarly, the DHCC’s work exposed a blind spot: humanities research, often framed as low-impact, relies on energy-intensive servers and cloud computing that contribute to carbon emissions—emissions that scholars have a responsibility to acknowledge and mitigate.

                        AI is widely hailed as a critical tool for addressing climate change, from optimizing renewable energy grids to modeling deforestation (Sabeena, 2025). Yet this framing obscures a fundamental dualism: AI’s potential to advance sustainability is inseparable from its role as a driver of environmental harm.

                        Crawford and Joler (2018) vividly illustrate this paradox through their anatomy of the Amazon Echo: its “intelligence” depends on extracting rare earth minerals, manufacturing in energy-intensive factories, and operating on servers powered by non-renewable energy. As Konya and Nematzadeh (2023) note, data centers—essential for AI’s computing power—remain heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels, undermining the very sustainability AI purports to enable.

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        This dualism extends beyond resource extraction to systemic inequity. Sabeena (2025) argues that AI’s climate solutions must center “social inequality, economic prosperity, and sustainable resource planning” (p. 390), yet AI’s development often exploits marginalized communities: extractive industries for rare earth minerals disproportionately harm Indigenous lands, while the energy demands of AI infrastructure exacerbate environmental injustice in regions where fossil fuel plants are sited.

                        For me, this meant confronting the environmental impact of my own scholarly work—from maintaining a GitHub page to storing research data on cloud servers. As Little et al. (2025) argue, even “small” digital practices (e.g., hosting websites, sharing large datasets) accumulate into significant carbon emissions when scaled across the discipline.

                        The DHCC’s <em>Guidelines for Sustainable Digital Practice</em> (2021) provided actionable steps to mitigate this impact: using self-hosted, energy-efficient platforms like Reclaim Hosting instead of commercial cloud services; compressing data to reduce storage needs; and publishing open access materials to avoid redundant reproduction of research. These practices are not merely technical—they are ethical.

                        Aaron Swartz’s activism, as documented in <em>The Internet’s Own Boy</em>, redefined my understanding of open knowledge as a practice of justice. Swartz’s attempt to download millions of JSTOR articles (Lessig, 2004) was not merely a protest against paywalls but a demand for knowledge as a public good—one that should be accessible to all, regardless of ability to pay.

                        Yet Luke (2018) warns against romanticizing openness as a panacea: “algorithmic infrastructures embed power dynamics that amplify some voices while excluding others” (p. 187). Openness, in other words, is not inherently equitable; it requires intentional design to challenge, rather than reproduce, systemic inequalities.

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Swartz’s legacy also highlights the intersection of open knowledge and sustainability. As the DHCC (2021) notes, “sustainability requires a commitment beyond merely producing tangible things, including cultivating a culture of openness” (p. 7). Open access, for example, reduces the environmental cost of printing and distributing physical books and journals, while also promoting equity by making scholarship accessible to researchers in low-resource contexts.

                        This reflection has been shaped by a core insight: digital culture is inherently material. AI systems are not abstract algorithms but networks of extraction, labor, and energy; digital scholarship leaves carbon footprints that reverberate across planetary systems; open knowledge is not a neutral ideal but a material practice that shapes power and equity.

                        My journey from viewing technology as neutral to recognizing its embeddedness in social and environmental systems has been driven by three key interventions: Crawford and Joler’s (2018) materialist critique of AI, the DHCC’s (2021) call for sustainable digital practice, and Swartz’s (2014) activism for open knowledge justice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Together, these interventions point to a vision of digital culture rooted in responsibility: responsibility to the planet, by minimizing extractive practices and carbon emissions; responsibility to communities, by centering equity in AI development and knowledge access; and responsibility to future generations, by building sustainable infrastructures that prioritize long-term well-being over short-term innovation. For digital humanists, this means rejecting the myth of technological neutrality and embracing a critical, reflective practice—one that interrogates the material consequences of our tools, the environmental costs of our research, and the power dynamics of our knowledge production.
